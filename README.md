# Veins_patterning
This repository contains source codes to simulate the signalling network involved in veins refinement and described in the paper "Signalling-dependent refinement of a rough prepattern allows reproducible binary cell fate choice in a dynamic tissue".

**Simulation on the wing tissue template**
The script """Wing_simulation.py""" perform a simulation on the experimental wing. To run """Wing_simulation.py""" one has to import the files """tissue_miner.py""" and """tissue_miner_tools.py""", which contain classes and functions to extract data from wing movies.
