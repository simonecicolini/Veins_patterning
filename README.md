# Veins_patterning
This repository contains source codes to simulate the signalling network involved in veins refinement and described in the paper "Signalling-dependent refinement of a rough prepattern allows reproducible binary cell fate choice in a dynamic tissue".

**Simulation on the wing tissue template**

The script ```Wing_simulation.py``` perform a simulation on the experimental wing. To run ```Wing_simulation.py``` one has to import ```tissue_miner.py``` and ```tissue_miner_tools.py```, which contain classes and functions to extract data from wing movies.
